# üõí Online Shop REST API

This REST API is developed to serve as the backend of an online shop. ADMIN users are allowed to manage the products. Registered users can create orders and review products by leaving a comment and scoring. Unauthenticated users can only browse through the products.
The API uses the HTTP protocol to allow users to interact with the system through a series of defined URLs. To design these solutions, the following technologies were used:

- Java 17 :coffee:
- Spring Boot 3.2.1 :leaves: 
- Maven for dependency management :elephant:
- MySQL database engine :dolphin: and data persistence with JPA and Hibernate.

The main dependencies used are:

- Spring Data JPA (Persist SQL databases using Java Persistence API using Spring Data and Hibernate.)
- Spring Web (Build web applications, including RESTful, using Spring MVC. Use Apache Tomcat as the default built-in container.)
- Spring Security (JWT Authentication)

## :space_invader: Design patterns:

### DTO (Data Transfer Object):
This pattern is used to transfer data between different layers of the application and to improve the security of the application by controlling what data is transferred.

## :computer: Endpoints:
**NOTE:** Each endpoint request will be authorized based on the user role. Authenticated users that have the ***ADMIN*** role will be able to perform all of the HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE). 
Authenticated users that have the ***USER*** role will be able to perform some POST and GET actions. Users that are not authenticated will be able to perform some GET actions. Each endpoint will specify which roles have permission to perform requests to it.

## :octocat: CI-Continuous Integration:

GitHub Actions is used for continuous integration. GitHub Actions is an automation tool that allows you to run automated workflows in response to specific events, such as the creation of a merge request. This tool automates test execution, application packaging, and deployment to different environments, all within the same workflow. This saves time and reduces errors by ensuring that the application is built correctly with every change made to the code. GitHub Actions allows you to customize configurations to meet the specific needs of the project.

## :bullettrain_side: CD-Continuous Deployment:

AWS is used for continuous deployment. The application hosting platform provides continuous deployment functionality that allows any code changes to be automatically deployed to a production environment. Using Github as a source, Railway triggers an automatic build and deployment to the production environment on every change to the repository without the need for manual intervention.
